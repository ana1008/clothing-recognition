# Clothing Recognition

Clothing recognition is recently getting more and more attention in the vision community due
to its usefulness in real-world applications, such as online social networking, e-commerce,
trend analysis, or personal fashion recommender. Recognition of clothing categories is
appealing to emerging applications such as security, intelligent customer profile analysis and
computer-aided fashion design. This also serves as the basis for more advanced clothing
analysis such as parsing, style understanding and attribute recognition.
This project aims to build a clothing recognition system that can be used by a clothing store to
recognise the clothes worn by the customers entering the store. The system is shown here to be
working on still images but can easily be extended to work on a CCTV surveillance footage.
To extend the system to work with surveillance footage, the video needs to be sampled at a
fixed sampling rate and fed to the system. It is assumed that the video will be sampled every 5
seconds and at a time only 1 person will be entering the store.
